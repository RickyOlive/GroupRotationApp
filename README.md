# Programming II Group Rotation App

Project Functionality -

The purpose of this project is to give the user a desktop application that allows them to seamlessly create schedules that deal with roations. For example suppose you have a employees and you would like to delage tasks to each of them that rotate on a daily basis. This application makes it simple for you to enter the names of the employees as well as the different tasks then generate a schedule based on this. You can also save this schedule to a text file.

Project Reason -

The reason for me picking this project is because my church rotates different locations for our ministry. For example we have service groups and every week they get a new location to conduct their preaching work. I wanted to create an easy way for them to generate schedules in a way that doesnt overlap and each group can get a new location each week. Plus I really wanted to make a desktop applicaiton that anyone can download and use for their scheduling needs. Not only that it taught me a lot about GUI's as well as event handlers so it really was a win-win. I personally had a lot of fun coding this up and because it was a reason close to home I was highly motivated to make it as nice as possible.
